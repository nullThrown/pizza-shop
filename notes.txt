      REFACTORING CONSIDERATIONS
     
     Business Logic/JS

      General 
        * have clear usage of proper function names/verbs 
        get -- gets data from LS
        set -- sets data into LS
        render -- grabs data from LS and places onto DOM/ usually accompanied by an element creation  
        toggle -- alters between two states of being(i.e hidden/shown, true/false etc.)
        populate -- data is filled into pre-existing fields(i.e radio buttons, summary)
        delete -- removes data from LS
        init -- initiliazes something, usually an object or other data structure necessary to store information 

        *test on all browsers -- desktop and phone

        *fix isDuplicate fn() on cart object
        *refactor eventlisteners  
          write single function or two separate ones if necessary for size change selectors and count selectors 
           use querySelectorAll to select food item divs and then select elements from within --- 
           not sure why I think this is better, but at one point it struck me to do it this way
           and at the time it appeared to make sense 
           even though now I'm not sure why that would be better. 

        *write separate function for add to cart buttons 
           
        Index
        
          Most Popular
            *order online button links to respective menu page 
              *also link to specific section in the page 
          
          Deals
            *have deal run function on final price 
            *add function that displays a popup for removed deal
            *remove settimeout so that all popups will be displayed for 3 seconds
            
    UI Changes/HTML, CSS

    *make all red colors consistent -- use variables. Use 2-3 red colors 
    

    All pages
      *fix cart item count animation to run upon item addition
      *change all primary headers to cool font 
      *find logo to replace Pizza Guys text  
      *mess around with secondary title fonts(i.e order online, most popular, menu, about) 
    
    Index

      Deals  
        *add popup when a item is removed       
  
    Menu
      Food Item Card  
        *change food item title fonts -- very boring 
        *add hover effect to more info buttons -- to show toppings etc.
