          set -- sets data into LS
          delete -- removes data from LS
          render -- grabs data from LS and places onto DOM/ often accompanied by an element creation  
          toggle -- alters between two states of being(i.e hidden/shown, true/false etc.)
          populate -- data is filled into pre-existing fields(i.e radio buttons, summary)
          init -- initiliazes something 
          handle -- fn to be called on triggered event
