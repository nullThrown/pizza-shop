  TODO
    *finish menu CartItem creation -- figure out how to create a base case and spread it into each specific case (i.e., 'pizza', 'side')
    *all 'removes' fn() names that remove items from LS should be renamed to 'delete' 
     -'remove' should be used only for node removals  
    *remove 'drink' title from menu page
    *blend render cart and sidebar into single function -- they both create the same content -- just in different containers
      - both functions call the same node creation functions -- they just need to be placed in their respective containers 
     *order now buttons on index should dropdown an item customize and add func
      -redesign buttons and add south facing arrow
     JS/LOGIC
      *place all init exports on top of file with listener exports 
      *checkout has buggy behavior -- order is placed happens even addToCartBtn disabled
      *switch toggle to handle
      *normalize all number data 
        - number data is being pull from DOM as a string and needs to be converted into a number
        - in order to run arithmetic ops on these numbers, they must be converted at a certain point
        - normalize this process and remove all the excess parseFloat/Number calls
    

      customPizza.js
        *rename files to custom
        *refactor meatsBtn,veggiesBtn, &, cheeseBtn listener logic -- it is way too verbose and ugly
    
      menu.js
      sidebar.js
        * sidebar needs redesign
          - look up other sidebars and try to find a nice design
            -reorganize contents within sidebars          
         
      General 
        *function name conventions
          get -- gets data from LS
          set -- sets data into LS
          delete -- removes data from LS
          render -- grabs data from LS and places onto DOM  
          toggle -- alters between two states of being(i.e hidden/shown, true/false etc.)
          populate -- data is filled into pre-existing fields(i.e radio buttons, summary)
          init -- initiliazes something 
          handle -- fn to be called on triggered event  
        
    Future Considerations
          *create an order placed page and make it look nice 
          *check about para with grammarly
          *add hover effect to more info buttons -- to show toppings etc.
          * isDuplicate fn() that checks if item-to-be-added already exists in cart
   
          ALERT  
           *change alert UI
           *remove settimeout so that all popups will be displayed for 3 seconds
           *add popup when a item is removed    
           *have deal run function on final price
