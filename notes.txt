     Business Logic
     
      General 
        *fix isDuplicate fn() on Js:116
        *find file structure suitable for project
        *refactor eventlisteners  
          write single function or two separate ones if necessary for size change selectors and count selectors 
           use querySelectorAll to select food item divs and then select elements from within --- 
           not sure why I think this is better,but, at one point it struck me to do it this way
           and at the time it appeared to make sense 
           even though now I'm not sure why that would be better. 

        *write separate function for add to cart buttons 
           
        Index
        
          Order Online 
            *add functionality to pickup and Delivery buttons 
            *set property on order/cart object -- for either pick up or delivery 
            *link to menu page

          Deals
            *onclick -- add specific deal to cart object 
              *have deal run function on final price 

        Menu 
          Cart
            *figure out how to save cart across mutliple page loads(i.e localstorage)
            *how to save a placed order that can be saved later down the road
            *add functionality to checkout button 
            *disable checkout button unless cart.length > 0


  UI Changes

    All pages
      *find logo to replace Pizza Guys text  
      *mess around with secondary title fonts(i.e order online, most popular, menu, about) 
      *add cart icon to all pages
    Index
      *change pickup and delivery button look 
       they look very boring
      *fix order now buttons on most popular section 
      
    Menu
      Food Item Card  
        *change look of food item cards -- make them more visible and stylish
        *change food item title fonts -- very boring 
        *change selectors(i.e size, crust, sauce, count) use KP video on YT
        *add hover effect to more info buttons -- to show toppings etc.

      Make Your Own 
        *create make your own page 
        *set up for toppings on one half or another or both 
      
      Checkout Page   
        *add checkout page that is linked to by the cart
          
    About 
      My Story Section
        *change background and border of my story text box -- something light grey and faded perhaps
