  TODO  
    *normalize all number data 
      - number data is being pull from DOM as a string and needs to be converted into a number
      - in order to run arithmetic ops on these numbers, they must be converted at a certain point
      - normalize this process and remove all the excess parseFloat/Number calls
    
     *alert component
      -rename popup to alert -- keep consistency
      -add JS func to alert to be set off when certain actions are committed 
      -keep removal/addition of items same color 
      -add func to cancel buttons
      -remove settimeout so that all popups will be displayed for 3 seconds
      
    *have deal run function on final price
 
    *create an order placed page and make it look nice 
    *check 'about' para with grammarly
    *add hover effect to more info buttons -- to show toppings etc.
    
  AFTER THOUGHTS
    
    
    *all 'removes' fn() names that remove items from LS should be renamed to 'delete' 
     -'remove' should be used only for node removals  

    
    *order now buttons on index should dropdown an item customize and add func
      -redesign buttons and add south facing arrow
    
    *finish menu CartItem creation -- figure out how to create a base case and spread it into each specific case (i.e., 'pizza', 'side')
      
    *customPizza.js
      -rename files to custom
      -refactor meatsBtn,veggiesBtn, &, cheeseBtn listener logic -- it is way too verbose and ugly
    
    * isDuplicate fn() that checks if item-to-be-added already exists in cart 
          
         
      General 
        *function name conventions
          get -- gets data from LS
          set -- sets data into LS
          delete -- removes data from LS
          render -- grabs data from LS and places onto DOM  
          toggle -- alters between two states of being(i.e hidden/shown, true/false etc.)
          populate -- data is filled into pre-existing fields(i.e radio buttons, summary)
          init -- initiliazes something 
          handle -- fn to be called on triggered event
