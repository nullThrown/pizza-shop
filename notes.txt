  TODO   
    *pass in new fontAwesome cdn link to all pages     
    *sauce selectors for sides are passing wrong values to LS

    *blend render cart and sidebar into single function        
      -add empty cart node to cart/sidebarCart if !items 
      -add order type to sidebar 
      -add comment describing why sidebar cart is being rendered from cart.js    

    *rework all component node creators to return only strings 
      -rename functions to '*str'

    *normalize all number data 
      - number data is being pull from DOM as a string and needs to be converted into a number
      - in order to run arithmetic ops on these numbers, they must be converted at a certain point
      - normalize this process and remove all the excess parseFloat/Number calls
    
     *alert component
      -alert placement is fucked 
        -alert work well when it was inside of a grid 
        -now stuck in flex and appears inline with header elements
        -needs to be attached to the bottom of header 
      -UI needs revamp
      -remove settimeout so that all popups will be displayed for 3 seconds
      -add popup when a item is removed    
      -have deal run function on final price
    
    
  AFTER THOUGHTS
    
    *all 'removes' fn() names that remove items from LS should be renamed to 'delete' 
     -'remove' should be used only for node removals  

    *create an order placed page and make it look nice 
          *check 'about' para with grammarly
          *add hover effect to more info buttons -- to show toppings etc.
          * isDuplicate fn() that checks if item-to-be-added already exists in cart 
    
    *order now buttons on index should dropdown an item customize and add func
      -redesign buttons and add south facing arrow
    
    *finish menu CartItem creation -- figure out how to create a base case and spread it into each specific case (i.e., 'pizza', 'side')
      
    *customPizza.js
      -rename files to custom
      -refactor meatsBtn,veggiesBtn, &, cheeseBtn listener logic -- it is way too verbose and ugly
    
          
         
      General 
        *function name conventions
          get -- gets data from LS
          set -- sets data into LS
          delete -- removes data from LS
          render -- grabs data from LS and places onto DOM  
          toggle -- alters between two states of being(i.e hidden/shown, true/false etc.)
          populate -- data is filled into pre-existing fields(i.e radio buttons, summary)
          init -- initiliazes something 
          handle -- fn to be called on triggered event  
        
    Future Considerations
          
   
          ALERT
